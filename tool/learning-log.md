* Watched 2 videos on youtube about WowJs

* Then went over to JsBin to test out all 3 of my tools
  *  Started coding and making random things, testing out different properties that you can use
  *  Learned how to create animations, timing them on how long I would like for them to be runned for, adding buttons.
*  Looked over the guides [Bulma](https://bulma.io/documentation/start/overview/)
