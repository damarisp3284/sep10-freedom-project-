# Presentation Plan

## Hook
* Ever wonder why climate change is a huge topic, especcially with our governmant and other world powers?
* Why do we care so much about it? 

## Product
* Add in a GIF 

## Process
* Looking at the internet with information on how Technology has contributed to combat affects of climate change such as pollution. Devices created for this purpose or keep track of the air quality as well as, keeping my website layout minimum and getting creative with my tool wowjs.
* Provice code snippets 

## Conclusion
* 

<!-- EXAMPLE

## Hook
* Verbal riddle of GGD

## Product
* GIF/Demo of example/non-example

## Process
* Flowchart of plan
  * MVP: noun -> door -> yes/no
  * Beyond MVP: noun -> word relation API -> noun API -> yes/no, with counterexample
* Code snippets of:
  * MVP
  * Both APIs
  * Challenge with API keys

## Conclusion
* [URL to project]
* Takeaways
  * Less = more: the heart of the riddle was one line of code; it obviously took more to make the entire thing work, but one complicated line of regular expressions was essentially the solution to the riddle
  * Expect the unexpected: it’s important to budget time for things you don’t account for; for example, I didn’t consider the fact that I would need another entire API to detect nouns
  * Determination is key: ironically enough, I had to make my API keys private. At first, it didn’t seem like it was possible, which meant I couldn’t publish my app. But after all of that hard work, I was determined to find a solution, and I found it in config variables.
* "Presentation can’t, but a speech can"
