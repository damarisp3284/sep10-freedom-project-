#### Choosing our tools 

---
<h1>Context</h1>

With Spring Semester arriving we are know starting to choose our tools to build our freedom projects, our teacher _Mr.Muller_ gave us a list of tools we can try out and use, with each being ranked based on difficulty. I decided to choose `Aframe`, `ReactJS`, `WowJS`. Once we chose our tools that sounded interesting to us we had to look around test our examples, look at videos, guides, and `tinker` which is just us testing out by coding something with our tool of choice **First** before we are **100%** sure we decide to use that tool and not end up regretting our choice.

#### Choice 1: WowJS

With **WowJS** I decided to look over youtube tutorials to see examples of ways to use it. Afterwards I decided to tinker on my own with what I've manage to understand, there are different types of animations you can use. I tried using the bounce animation in which whatever text I add in it will automatically have the animation

Then I tried getting creative since I liked the idea that you can add animation to your text and I thought this was a creative way to add something cool in my website. With more tinkering I got to experiment the other animations in which my result was:

The animations can also be extended for whatever time we want it to run as well as if we want it to last forever or have it repeat a certain amount of time in which i added this to my code that I was tinkering:

#### Choice 2: Bulma

I decided to change my choice of **Aframe** to bulma because it was more challenging for me to understand and it was more use of geometry since we are working with shapes in which you have to coordinate what position your piece will go. With Bulma you can create different features for your websites such as buttons, I tried to uses some of the button variables to tinker around in which I got:

Another feature about Bulma is something called `Skeleton`, acting as a placeholder for whatever context we decide to add in so that users can interact with, similar to when adding in `<p>`.

#### Choice 3: ReactJs

I decided to go with **ReactJs** because I wanted to do a bit of a challenge for myself and I also liked how when you're trying to include videos the formatting can look attention seeking to users. Some features were mostly UI features, in which users can interact.

Such as a tic-tac-toe game as a guide for users to start understant the concepts:

I tried to make my own board:

<h1>Skills</h1>

#### Time management
Using **Mid-Winter Break** as a time to explore around and see what my top 3 choices were about and other tutorials/tips that can help me understant and navagate more better when I try to tinker and add in my own ideas. I started to do 1 at a time and not try to use them all at once and with the break it gave me a sense of time and not having to worry about other classwork that can interfere with my time. 

#### Embracing failure 
Since I saw how **Aframe** was a popular choice and went entering into the website it really caught my attention into trying it out as one of my tools, despite looking over at tutorials, examples and even asking some of my friends for help, I couldn't understand how to properly use it or I was having a hard time, spending a ton of time trying to debug errors that I didn't know how to tackle. Although it did defeated me I knew I shouldn't spend all my effort into it and decided why not choose another tool from the list.

#### How to read
As websites like **W3Schools** has a whole list of HTML and CSS commands, examples and a full on guide on how/what they do. With the websites from my tools and their starter code had a way different layout than what I was used to when I looked on help in W3Schools, some bits had java script but most of the time it was just HTML and CSS commands so I didn't had a hard time knowing what to use when I started to tinker and try to build my own experiment on **JSBin**.

<h1>Overview</h1>

Using Youtube, google, along with the starter guides that are included in the websites help me navagate and fully understant when tryint to decide if I want to keep that choice or not as well as tinkering. Without our teacher's plan of us tinkering and adding in from what we understood from the guide, I wouldn't know how to use that tool or even know if I will be able to use it without struggling. Using these sources also helped me view how others use these tools to help others that are also trying to look around and see if that website is perfect for them or not.
