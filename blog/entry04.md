#### Choosing our tools 

---
<h1>Context</h1>

With Spring Semester arriving we are know starting to choose our tools to build our freedom projects, our teacher _Mr.Muller_ gave us a list of tools we can try out and use, with each being ranked based on difficulty. I decided to choose `Aframe`, `ReactJS`, `WowJS`. Once we chose our tools that sounded interesting to us we had to look around test our examples, look at videos, guides, and `tinker` which is just us testing out by coding something with our tool of choice **First** before we are **100%** sure we decide to use that tool and not end up regretting our choice
