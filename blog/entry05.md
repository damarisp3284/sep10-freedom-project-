# Entry 5
##### 04/11/25

During March and now April we have been learning about our tool and some days in March and now fully in April. Using this time I have been learning about **Bulma**.

---

## Context

Our teacher **Mr. Mueller** had given us a `Learning log` as a way to track our progress with what we are learning in our tool such as tinkering, videos on **Youtube**, guides or anything we have been doing as proof that we are learning this on our own and using that to tinker. 

In my learning log I have been tinkering in **JS Bin** with properties like `Skeleton`

As well as `Buttons`:

Apart from using [Bulma's documentation](https://bulma.io/documentation/) as well as [A pickcode](https://app.pickcode.io/project/cm8rnhkdg3czp13zddxe96yz2) To which I tinkered and added in some features that I have learned. Using [This video](https://youtu.be/bd_jHBk8Kzw?si=cQmZKucG0eQ8SV8-) As a model [Video #2](https://youtu.be/-mIWhsZ0Wxo?si=TFKAgwxeqxacrYS2) for inspiration.

## Skills

Using google for when I needed help or didn't understant what the documentation in `Bulma` stated helped especially when it was **Youtube vidoes** or actual people replying to question that had an issue similar to mine. 

Learning to understand the different ways that a property can be used had many different features such as add in videos or css, the way a user can place it or how it will look like in a different device was overwhelming but I liked how it's very open to other properties that you can use for your website.
