# Entry 7
##### 5/20/25
 
As we now have finished our freedom projects after weeks of working on them and doing our **MVP** first before anything, we have started to do our presentation as June is approaching.

---

## Context

After finishing our freedom project our teacher **Mr.Mueller** has given us an overview of our timeline with this class, during the final weeks of May and entering June we are going to start working on our project's presentation, but first we had to plan out first and then we can move on to create our slides to first present to our class and then we will start to display our work at the **SEP Expo** in June. 

We started to plan out our **Wireframe** first to see what we would like our website to look like and add in any components we would want for what content we would add based on our [notes and information](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m_cwGESryE63ud1gwiAZDmElCy6F94UukC4jca5qnCc/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.pywigtbq1lln) we have gathered during our one-year research since the start of **September**. For my wireframe I decided to go with something simple as much of my information was mostly images and Links. Which my final design looked like:

While I created a mobile wireframe I also created one for desktop users:

Once we got apporved we got started on building our website with doing first our **MVP** and setting up deadlines to what we needed to add by a certain day and move on to other things like adding in coomponents or context, tthem moving on to designing, making it look colorful, and presentable. Including on our tool we have been tinkering during April but we had to explain how we used it in our project. 

At first I wanted to use **Bulma** but then when my teacher **Mr.Mueller** went over to ask me about my wireframe to specify what I was gonna use my tool but then recommended me to use my 2nd choice, `WowJs` so I went with that and started to include it based on the [Official Documentation](https://wowjs.uk/docs.html) but also lead me to the documentation of [Animate CSS](https://animate.style/). 



## Skills 

**Using Google** to search up anything that I was confused on or I forgot on what other variable I was supposed to add in for my code and also using **W3Schools** webpage, other help forums that were created for users that needed support from the community. **Communication** also helped me as I got to intereact with other **SEP** students such as seniors that got to help me debug my codding when I couldn't find an error or something wasn't functioning in my project. **Organization** helped me organize and plan what I needed to do first such as planning what were the smaller problems first before tackling the bigger problems.
