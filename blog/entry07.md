# Entry 7
##### 5/20/25
 
As we now have finished our freedom projects after weeks of working on them and doing our **MVP** first before anything, we have started to do our presentation as June is approaching.

## Context

After finishing our freedom project our teacher **Mr.Mueller** has given us an overview of our timeline with this class, during the final weeks of May and entering June we are going to start working on our project's presentation, but first we had to plan out first and then we can move on to create our slides to first present to our class and then we will start to display our work at the **SEP Expo** in June.
