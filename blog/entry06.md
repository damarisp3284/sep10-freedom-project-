# Entry 6
##### 5/5/25

Through the month of April we have started to work on our freedom project website and for now we have made progress with just doing our **MVP** first.

# Context 

We started to use our notes that we have collected at the beginning of the year with our topic that we have chosen, using what information we have found through our own research to guide us on what we would like our website to look like. Then start to plan out our website formatting with **wireframe**, once we have an approval of how it looks by our teacher **Mr.Mueller** we can start to build our website based on our wireframe plan. 

I was planning to do something simple but also fun to interact so I decided to add in a few components first before trying to add in more if I needed to improve my website, we had to create 2 wireframes for mobile and desktop users 


My Mobile Wireframe:

After building our websites we had to look at other classmate's pages to give feedback on what they can improve or add onto and what was something we liked aboout their website. 

My current [Website](https://damarisp3284.github.io/sep10-freedom-project-/) so far still has some flaws but with my classmates suggestions

Our teacher wanted us to look around and what was the most repetative things that are listed so that we can focus on fixing those issues first and see what other minor changes we wanted to add on.

#### Challenges 

A challenge I faced was trying to add in 3 columns which based on my mobile wireframe I thought it was going to be dived into 3 single sections but instead everything was squeezed into thin lines but since I added in my sources for where I got my information from it was blocking my cards that were below it. Looking back at [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/) and other pages that had similar issues as mine I manage to change the css properties of my columns for it to divde into 3 rectangles when it's on a mobile device.

#### Skill 

Using Google and peer feedback has helped me build my project as something we can forget things or we need some type of advice from others to see if you feel confident in presenting your work. Google has helped me in times where I wanted to make sure what I was adding on my code had the correct values and input, managing our time has helped since we we're crowding in everything and took our time to make it look nice and plan what we have to add on first.
