#### Brainstorming Our Own Ideas (Part B)

With Winter Break coming near we have decided to continue working on our **Freedom Project** for the time being. 

We first had to brainstorm our ideas for the future we would like to create, our teacher _Mr Muller_ gave us examples of how to list our ideas such as first creating Big ideas with details, another one could be few ideas with little details etc. 

At first I felt clueless and lost with no where to start but with using from what I have with Part A and B I started by going back and viewing what Information I have and with that I started to brainstorm ideas with inspiration of my current data that I have collected.

Also with using some examples from past projects that my teacher has posted with the slides from the day's lesson to kind of give me an idea of how to sort it out or some model on how it will simmilarly look like. 

Using the websites that I found like [The University Of Washington](https://guides.lib.uw.edu/c.php?g=1117513&p=8195685), a website called [Neefuse](https://www.neefusa.org/story/climate-change/calculating-future), and [A list of new invented Gadgets](https://www.greenlivingblog.org.uk/top-eco-friendly-home-gadgets/). As references to start my **Engineering design process**, first Brainstorm and plan to create something that can help benefit our enviroment and climate change. 

Once we were done with our list we moved on with finalizing our context so we can show it to our classmates and get feedback on what else we can add on as well as from our teacher so we can start writing up our `Blog 3`.

#### Finallizing Our Content 

After adding all my feedback that I have recieved we had 3 options, a day to catch up on work, waiting for feedback from _Mr.Muller_ and start working on `Blog 3` and then come back to our google doc to check if we have everything right, or if we have everything perfect and _Mr Mueller_ thinks your work is good to go then you can start to focus on `Blog 3`

I went back and followed what _Mr.Muller_ had left for me to correct but luckily I had started working on `Blog 3`. Strenghtening my websites introduction to explain how I will examine both existing and future technologies that have been invented for _Enviroment_. 

I plan to explain how every since **Climate change** became such a big topic over the following years and more more people have been advocating for our government to start taking action to secure a better and cleaner future. With these ideas came in great inventions that had made positive changes and benefits to our health and earth. Making my text not to repetative and boring but also give a quick summary on smaller parts of information.

#### Skills
Using `Time management` can help because despite having other classes and work to do, I've learned that it's best to prioritze your time on important assingments first like something that is **REALLY** important that you need to focus on more, but also to stop procrasinating on what your going to do first and avoid multitasking big assingments because your're not going to work the same as when you only focus on one assingment and putting effort into it.

`Problem decomposition` helped me break down my list of ideas as well as `Organization`, with these skills I can have a neat and ordered list, avoid giving myself a headache on what I should write down on my ideas or what details I should add. 

Not everything will be perfect as I hoped it would look like so learning to `Embracing failure` has giving me a lesson of not everything will go all perfect and we will end up making mistakes or hitting dead ends and we feel hopeless so we lose motivation.

Never letting dead ends let me lose my hope and still have motivation gave me confidence and still trying to add on to my seaches or digging in through the other options that _Google_ has found because altough there is really good websites, information, and most viewed articles sometimes we never give our time to look over the other results.

#### Summary

After the break has ended im looking forward to what we will continue to do next and how my Website will look like once we are with the Freedom Project, but also how my skills continue to grow and improve.
