As we continue to work on our freedom project, we have been tasked to research on **Hardware** and **Software** for our topics that we have chosen. 

# Searching

##### Software
Searching for Enviroment was difficult because it didn't have much on ``Hardware`` and ``Software`` so I hit alot of dead ends in which I had to modify most of what I was googling such as combining the words ``Enviroment`` with either ``Apps`` , ``Hardware and Software``.

I've noticed when searching up ``Software`` , most of the information was about collecting data to compare from past years and observing the possibility of what our Enviroment might look like in the future. It was mostly about information to give to the readers in there webpages and learn more about the Enviroment as well as climate change related issues.

##### Hardware

Searching for _Hardware_ was more easier compared to _Software_ because this was more related to the work force and what has been created to help combat climate change and avoid other future issues that can affect future generations. ``Gadgets`` we're helpful when trying to find any hardware related things to the Enviroment as I discovered the creation of tools such as devices that can help monitor your air quality, control how much dust can get in your house. 

Revising my searches helped when I hit a dead end because I found more useful information about Enviroment related technology but not alot of major tools have been created so far, yet people still do try there best to come up with new devices and creations to have the future generations avoid any climate problems such as pollution which can affect the air quality that we breath in.
